# Movies Search - Mobile Development 


---
## Description 

This is an application for Android devices that is used to search for movies. Initially, the page shows the top 20 most popular rated shows/movies. You could also input a query and hit the search bar which would send a request to the API to get data about all of the results with the same name. You could then click on the movies to see the exact one you're looking for. When a movie is clicked, a picture, the title, overview, as well as the first aired date should appear.
